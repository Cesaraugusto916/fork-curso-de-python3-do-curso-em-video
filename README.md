Hello! This is a public repository.

In this repository, you will find my learnings of the "Python 3" course
from "Curso em VÃ­deo" by Prof. Gustavo Guanabara. 

Initially, I had this repository named "python-3-mundo-1", with all the files
from this "mundo" here. On october, 2020, I decided to change this: now, all three "mundos"
are inside one single repository, only in different folders.

This repository name also changed to "python-3-do-curso-em-video".

I hope these codes are helpful to you.

Cheers,

B.
